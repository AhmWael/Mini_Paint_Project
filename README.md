# Mini Paint Application

## Overview

This is a simplified painting application developed as part of the CC272 Programming II course at Alexandria University. The application, named "Mini Paint," allows users to draw, colorize, and manipulate basic geometric shapes (circles, rectangles, squares, and line segments).

This project is divided into two phases:

*   **Phase 1:** Implemented the core drawing and coloring functionality.
*   **Phase 2:** Enhanced the application by adding features such as moving, resizing, saving, and loading shapes from files.

## Features

*   **Shape Creation:**
    *   Supports drawing circles, rectangles, squares, and line segments.
    *   User-friendly dialog boxes for entering shape properties.
*   **Shape Manipulation:**
    *   Colorize shapes.
    *   Delete shapes.
    *   Move shapes to different positions (Phase 2).
    *   Resize shapes by adjusting dimensions (Phase 2).
*   **Shape Management:**
    *   Dropdown menu to select drawn shapes by unique names.
*   **File Operations:**
    *   Save drawn shapes to a file (Phase 2).
    *   Load shapes from a file (Phase 2).
*  **Undo and Redo functionality for the shapes (Phase 2)**
